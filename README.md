# Kelvin Edimeh — Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.

I am a Product Designer based in Lagos, focused on designing structured, scalable digital experiences that solve real business problems. This site showcases selected case studies, design thinking, and shipped work across web and product design.

## About the Website

The portfolio is designed to:

• Present case studies in a clear, outcome-focused structure
• Highlight product thinking, not just visuals
• Reflect a minimal, bold visual identity
• Maintain fast performance and responsiveness

The goal was simplicity with intention. No distractions. No unnecessary complexity.

## Featured Work

The site includes selected projects across:

• SaaS product design
• E-commerce experiences
• Landing pages
• Design systems and UI components
• Strategy-led product thinking

Each case study focuses on problem definition, process, decisions, and measurable results.

## Design Approach

This portfolio reflects how I think about design:

• Clarity over decoration
• Systems over isolated screens
• Business alignment over aesthetics
• Interaction precision over visual noise

If a product needs explaining, it needs redesigning.

## Tech Stack

The site is built with a modern, performance-focused stack:

• **HTML / CSS / TypeScript**: Core structure and logic
• **Vite**: Super-fast build tool and dev server
• **GSAP (GreenSock)**: High-performance animations and interactions
• **Lenis**: Smooth scrolling implementation
• **Formspree**: Contact form handling

## Performance & Accessibility

The site is built with:

• Responsive design principles
• Accessibility considerations
• Performance optimization in mind
